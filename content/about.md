Hi, I'm Jin Chen! I graduated from Drexel University in 2020 with a degree in Mangement Information Systems. I also minored in Politics and History. I began this website while learning R and stumbling across [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). 

I use this website to write about whatever's on my mind. This includes my life, R projects, and anything from politics to international relations and productivity.

**Currently:**

:seedling: Learning R with applications to business analytics.
