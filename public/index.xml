Specifically, I hope to answer whether expenditure on health and levels of alcohol consumption predict age of life expectancy in countries around the world.
Description of dataThe data set includes a variety of immunization, mortality, economic and social factors from 2000 - 2015 in 193 countries. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle here and is a combined from several datasets from the World Health Organization and the United Nations website.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jin Chen! I graduated from Drexel University in 2020 with a degree in Mangement Information Systems. I also minored in Politics and History. I began this website while learning R and stumbling across blogdown.
I use this website to write about whatever&amp;rsquo;s on my mind. This includes my life, R projects, and anything from politics to international relations and productivity.
Currently:
üìó Reading Prisoners of Geography
üå± Learning R with applications to business analytics.
‚ú≥Ô∏è Going through JHU&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Spcialization Course</description>
